ðŸ¥¥ CoconutLink
CoconutLink is a playful .NET demo app built for lightning talk sessions like LeedsSharp. It showcases how to supercharge boring string fields with rich text using HtmlAgilityPack â€” enabling modern UI features like @mentions while maintaining API compatibility.

This project demonstrates:

ðŸ”Œ Converting plain-text notes to structured HTML safely

ðŸ’¬ Adding @mentions and structured metadata inside notes

ðŸ§© Parsing and extracting rich content server-side in .NET

ðŸ§ª Simulated attendee mentions from the LeedsSharp meetup

Use CoconutLink to understand how to add rich content features to legacy systems without breaking the backend.
