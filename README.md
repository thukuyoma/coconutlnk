# coconutlnk
CoconutLink is a .NET demo app that shows how to enrich plain string fields with rich text using HTML Agility Pack. It parses structured HTML with mentions, making legacy fields more powerful without breaking APIsâ€”perfect for CRMs, notes, and collaborative tools. Built for LeedsSharp.
